Current features:
- Full zooming capability using OpenGL (compliments of Opioid2D)
- Image objects (only supports png, jpg, gif for now)
- Drag and drop using the Drop Box (innacurate though, after camera is moved and scaled around)
- Basic object manipulation using pseudomodes (only Ctrl for position/scale)
- Primitive selection system (no visual ques yet, sorry!)

Features to be added for first full release:
- Text objects (full text input/editing support compliments of Archy)
- Object search using tags with Global Leap (left/right Alt)
- Object creation
- Command system (again from Archy)
- All data types will be represented in some form (mostly a rectangle with the type stated inside it)

You need several packages in order to run Tzui (for I stand on the shoulders of giants):
- Python 2.5 (not tested on 2.4)
- wxPython
- Opioid2D alpha6 (http://opioid-interactive.com/opioid2d/)
- Pygame (required by O2D - download special build*, the one on pygame's page is broken)
- Numeric (required by O2D)

* Only if you have Python 2.5: http://opioid-interactive.com/~shang/python-win32/pygame-1.7.1release.win32-py2.5.exe
